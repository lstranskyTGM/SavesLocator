# Saves Locator

## Description:
A Python script that finds Minecraft save files in specified drives/directories copies them to a new location, and optionally creates a zip archive.

## Features:
- **Search For Minecraft Saves**: The script searches for directories containing exactly one 'level.dat' file, which is indicative of a Minecraft save.
- **Copy Files**: After locating the save files, the script can copy them to a new directory. Users have the option to copy only the save files or the entire directory structure.
- **Zip Files**: There's also an option to create a zip archive of the located save files.
